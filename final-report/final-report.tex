\begin{abstract}
The internship at the MacEwan University, under the guidance of Professor Cristina Anton, consisted of the study and experimentation with various model-based EM algorithms used to cluster contaminated functional data. The proposed algorithm, tfunHDDC and cfunHDDC were evaluated on benchmark datasets against some similar algorithms, funHDDC and funclust. The datasets used to benchmark the algorithms were the ECG and Kneading datasets.
