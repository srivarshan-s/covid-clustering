# **NOTES**

1. Perform funHDDC again with all the models and change the parameters

2. Perform tfunHDDC algorithm in a similar fashion to funHDDC

3. Try out cfunHDDC
   
   1. Set alpha from 0.8 to 0.95 with 0.05 increments and also 0.5, 0.6, 0.7
   
   2. Try changing alphamin
   
   3. Try varying the threshold
   
   4. This algorithm only works with fourier basis not bspline basis
   
   5. Get the eta value
