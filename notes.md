# **NOTES**

1. Perform funHDDC again with all the models and change the parameters

2. Perform tfunHDDC algorithm in a similar fashion to funHDDC

3. Try out cfunHDDC
   
   1. Set alpha from 0.8 to 0.95 with 0.05 increments
   
   2. There are two alphas (two clusters); try to set both as the same value
   
   3. Try varying the threshold
   
   4. This algorithm only works with fourier basis not bspline basis
