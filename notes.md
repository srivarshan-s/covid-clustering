# **NOTES**

1. ~~Run all the algorithms for the new number of splines~~ **NOT NECESSARY**

2. ~~Play with the threshold number to see the best values (lower seems to be better)~~ **NOT NECESSARY**

3. See the paper with the python code sent by Cristina
   
   1. Try to implement it on the ECG data

4. ~~See for different splines as 38 and 41 seem too high (if possible)~~ **NOT NECESSARY**

5. ~~Keep the Bsplines at 20 splines and run cfunHDDC (huge eta; good CCR)~~ **DONE**
   
   1. ~~copy the previous table and put some pictures (similar to nox data)~~ 
      
      1. ~~original data - two classes together~~
      
      2. ~~original data first and second (seperate)~~
      
      3. ~~best with tfun and cfun~~

6. Plot them along with the original data

7. Plot outliers with green

8. Try python code about forests in (Outlier detection in multivariate functional data through a contaminated mixture model)

9. Send plotting code to Cristina
