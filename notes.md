# **NOTES**

1. ~~clean up code~~

2. ~~kmeans~~

3. ~~10 nb.rep (start with 1, if max is obtained try surrounding with 10)~~

4. ~~threshold 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4~~

5. ~~[0, 1] -> time interval~~

6. Plot the data
   
   1. Pic with data and classes
   
   2. Another with outliers
   
   3. Final pic seperate into 3

7. Change the random seed (increase by 1 for every iteration)

8. Run the model longer for the best CCR (nb.rep = 50)

9. Concentration 9, 10 or 11 - Visualization with detourr

10. Work on functional isolation forest for flour data

11. Clean up ECG code
